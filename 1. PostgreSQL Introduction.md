# DBMS Notes

## SQL and R DBMS (using Postgres)

### What is PostgreSQL

Postgres is a free and open source Relational DataBase Management System (R DBMS) evolving from [Ingres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingres_(database)) Project at the University of California, Berkeley.

PostgreSQL features transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties, automatically updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures.

### What is ACID Principles in R DBMS

ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.

A Database Transaction symbolizes a unit of work, performed within a database management system (or similar system) against a database, that is treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. A transaction generally represents any change in a database.

#### Atomicity

Transactions are often composed of multiple statements. Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single "unit", which either succeeds completely or fails completely: if any of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete, the entire transaction fails and the database is left unchanged. 

An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes.

#### Consistency

Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one consistent state to another, making sure that any data written to the database is valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This prevents database corruption by an illegal transaction.

#### Isolation

Transactions are often executed concurrently. Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially. 

#### Durability

Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash). This usually means that completed transactions (or their effects) are recorded in non-volatile memory.
